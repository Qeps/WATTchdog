# Wattchdog â€“ IoT Project for Monitoring Local Power Consumption

This project focuses on monitoring power consumption in a local area using IoT technologies.
It consists of the following components:

- Measurement Circuit Simulation (LTSpice):
  Simulations of the measurement system performed in LTSpice to validate circuit design and behavior.

- Host Service (Raspberry Pi):
  A lightweight server running on a Raspberry Pi that provides a local network service accessible at wattchdog.local.
  It collects and displays data from measurement devices using the MQTT protocol.
